#   What is going on here? Can you explain the output?

tup = 'Hello'
print(len(tup))

#   output stream = 5
# tup           is a variable that stores the string 'Hello'.
# len(...)      is a function that returns the number of elements in an object.
#               In this case, returns the length of the associated string, which is 5.
